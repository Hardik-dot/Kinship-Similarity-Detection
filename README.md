# Kinship-Similarity-Detection - UCI CS 271P

(Tech Stack: Convolutional Siamese Network, OpenCV, Keras, Python)

â€€ The purpose of this projects is to determine if two individuals are related to each other. After applying pre-processing
techniques such as head-post estimation, face alignment & cropping and extracting the facial features, a multi-layer
Siamese network model was trained on the "Familes-in-the-wild" dataset and was able to predict with 72% accuracy
whether the people in the images are genetically related or not.
